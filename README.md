# farm_shane_fungi
Custom module for mushroom farming.

I created an overview page where all things Fungi can live and interact with the rest of farmOS.

It's just a simple "Hello World" page for now while I dive deeper into adding menu links to the page from the home screen unless someone can suggest a better way to accomplish the navigation within the farmOS UI framework. Once that is accomplished, I'll start to add dependencies and links to adding assets from the overview.
